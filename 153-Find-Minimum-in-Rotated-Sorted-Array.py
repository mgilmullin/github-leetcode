153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

A way of solving this problem is using the Binary Search algorithm. 
In binary search we find out the mid point and decide to either search on the left or right depending on some condition.
In this modified version of binary search algorithm, we are looking for the Inflection Point. 

All the elements to the left of inflection point > first element of the array.
All the elements to the right of inflection point < first element of the array.

Algorithm
1. Find the mid element of the array.

2. If mid element > first element of array this means that we need to look for the inflection point on the right of mid.

3. If mid element < first element of array this that we need to look for the inflection point on the left of mid.

4 . We stop our search when we find the inflection point, when either of the two conditions is satisfied:

nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1] Hence, mid+1 is the smallest.

nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid] Hence, mid is the smallest.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity : Same as Binary Search O(log N)
Space Complexity : O(1)
