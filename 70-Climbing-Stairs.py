70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45

Note:
Given n will be a positive integer.

Methodology
This question solved by Dynamic Programming.

Find the base case
When climb 1 stair, we need 1 step
when climb 2 stairs, we need 2 steps which 1+1 or 2
when climb 3 stairs, we need 3 steps which 1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1
when climb 4 stairs, we need 5 steps which 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2 â€¦. The base case will be:
dp[1]=1,
dp[2]=2,
dp[3]=3,
dp[4]=5

To reach the current stairs for example (stair 4), we can easily add 1 step from last stair (stair 3) and that will give us 1+1+1+1, 1+2+1, 2+1+1. Or we can easily add 2 steps from the one before last stair (stair 2) and that will give us 1+1+2 and 2+2. Since we can only move 1 or 2 steps each time. We do not need more previous stairs. So we get answer 5 in total.
