82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.
 

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

If a nodeâ€™s value repeats in other nodes, we want to delete all of these nodes. 
We have to compare with its previous value and keep a pointer at the previous value in case if we want to delete the current node. This include the head , and  we add a dummy node and point it to the head.

Detailed explanation in the comments.

Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(N) 

Space complexity: O(1) because we don't allocate any additional data structure.
